### Q1: What is Machine Learning?

Which could be considered examples of Machine Learning ?

```@example q0002

choices = [ # hide
  "An international team on oncologist has reviewes the empirical evidence on breast cancer and produced a decision support tool for practitioners that prescribes the best medical act to take on patients based on chemical, biological and istological characteristics of the tissues and the patient genetic, physical and medical condition", # hide
  "Your content provider suggests you the films it thinks you may like based on the films that you have already decided to watch and the review given by the other users that have viewing behaviours similar to yours", # hide
  "Your phone automatically compose a video by selecting the most beutiful photos", # hide, # hide
  "Your preferred photo editor tool function to cartonise your photos", # hide
  ]  # hide
answers = [2,3]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=false)  # hide
```

To be considered ML, an algorithm must learn the solution of the problem from the data.
In the oncologist example, it is humans that defines the outcomes, even if this decision is data-driven.
Similarly, in the photo editor, the parameters of the filters that are applied (convoluted) to the photo to cartonise it (or making whatever other effect) are not learn by the algorithm itself but explicitly engineered. We will see in the `NN` unit how this contrast with Convolutional Neural Networks, where the weights of these filters are instead learn.

The correct answer are:
  - Your content provider suggests you the films it thinks you may like based on the films that you have already decided to watch and the review given by the other users that have viewing behaviours similar to yours
  - Your phone automatically compose a video by selecting the most beutiful photos

### Q2: Kind of mchine Learning tasks

Which of the following statements are correct ?

```@example q0002

choices = [ # hide
  "In unsupervised (machine) learning the objective is to learn the relation between some inputs and some outputs from a sequence of pairs (inputs, outputs) provided to the algorithm", # hide
  "In supervised machine learning tasks the objective is to lean the relation between the provided features (inputs) and the provided labels (outputs)", # hide
  "In reinforcment learning tasks, the algorithm must find the best actions for a certain agent to perform given the different states of the words, the rewards that the agent is given at each possible state and the probabilities to reach the various states given the departing state and the available actions", # hide
  "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
  ]  # hide
answers = [4]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide
```

```@raw html

```
All sentences are wrong. Unsupervise machine learning, by definition, includes algorithms for which we do not provide exemples of a "correct" output for the different inputs. We try instead to find a pattern, a structure in the data itself.

Outputs are provided in supervised tasks. However the sentence reported is wrong, because we are not interested much in the relationship between the _provided_ inputs and outputs, but in finding a generic relationship between the inputs and the outputs for the population from which the data arise.

Fianlly, also the sentence on reinforcement learning is wrong, because in reinforcement learning we don't know the rewards associated to each state nor the probabilities to reach the various states associated to each action. This is what the algorithm need to discover (learn) by start "playing" autonomously.

The correct answer is:
  - None of the (other) sentences is correct
