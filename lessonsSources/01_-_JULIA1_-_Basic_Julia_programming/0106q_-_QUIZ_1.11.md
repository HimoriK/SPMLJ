### Q1: Metaprogramming theory

Which of the following statements are correct ?

```@example q011
choices = [ # hide
    "Metaprogramming in Julia refers to the possibility to change the text that defines the code statements before it is parsed", # hide
    "Macros in Julia allow to write concise code that would otherwise raise a syntax error without the macro", # hide
    "Macros in Julia allow to programmatically transform one or more code expressions in a different expression", # hide
    "Invoking a Julia macro implies making two different operations: first \"create\" an expression, and then evaluating it", # hide
    "A symbol allows to refer to an identifier rather than to the object associated (binded) to it", # hide
    "Expressions are composed of symbols", # hide
    "To evaluate an expression all the symbols referred in the expressions must be accessible at the global scope of where the evaluation happens", # hide
    "None of the (other) statements is correct", # hide
] # hide
answers = [3,4,5,6,7]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide
```

Concerning the wrong answers: the characteristic of metaprogramming in Julia is that the code is changed _after_ it is parsed in Expressions. For the same reasons we can't "go around" code that, without the macro, would create syntax errors (i.e. errors during parsing).

The correct answers are:
  - Macros in Julia allow to programmatically transform one or more code expressions in a different expression
  - Invoking a Julia macro implies making two different operations\: first "create" an expression, and then evaluating it
  - A symbol allows to refer to an identifier rather than to the object associated (binded) to it
  - Expressions are composed of symbols
  - To evaluate an expression all the symbols referred in the expressions must be accessible at the global scope of where the evaluation happens

### Q2: Evaluation of an expression

Given the following code snippet:\n
```julia
x = 10
y = 3
myMult = Meta.parse("$x * y")
x = 2
y = 5
output = eval(myMult)
```

Which of the following sentences are correct?

```@example q011

choices = [ # hide
    "`out` is `30`", # hide
    "`out` is `50`", # hide
    "`out` is `6`", # hide
    "`out` is `10`", # hide
    "The code produces an error during parsing", # hide
    "The code produces an error during compilation or execution", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
] # hide
answers = [2]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide
```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

The expression is made by the _content_ of variable `x` (because we are using the dollar sign) that multiplies the variable `y`. The evaluation of what `y` contains, used to make the actual multiplication, is done at the time of evaluating the expression, so the multiplication that is done is `10 * 5`

The correct answers are:
  - `out` is `50`

### Q3: Components of an expression

Given the following code snippet:

```julia
a         = [100,10,0]
expr      = Meta.parse("a[1]+1")
expr.XXXX = 2
```

To what `XXXX` should be replaced with, in order for the evaluation of `expr` to retun the value `11` ? (hint: you can dump the expression)

```@example q011

stringq(Regex("args[2].args[2]"))  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

We want to change the index of the array that we want to sum to the fixed value `1`, so to have the expression to evaluate to `10+1` instead of `100+1`. The expression is made of several nested expressions. First, we have a call to the addition operator (`+`) (first argument), the `a[1]` element (second argument) and the value `1` (third element). So we first want `args[2]`. Then we have a reference expression where the first argument is the variable (symbol) `a` and, finally, the second argument is the index value, `1` - that here we want to change to `2` -, so we want to have `expr.args[2].args[2] = 2`

The correct answer is: `args[2].args[2]`

### Q4: Macros

Given the following code snippet:

```julia
macro Foo(inExpr)
    return 2
end
@Foo a=3
a
```

Which of the following sentences are correct?

```@example q011

choices = [ # hide
    "`a` is `2`", # hide
    "`a` is `3`", # hide
    "`a` is not defined", # hide
    "The snippet returns an error during parsing", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
] # hide
answers = [3]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide

```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

The script leads to an evaluation error (i.e., not a parsing one) as `a` results not defined. The original expression of the assignment of `a` to `3` is not part of the ASL, what it is is a single, constant value `2` that is what the invocation of the macro produces. However this is not binded to `a`, so `a` in the expanded code is not even present.

The correct answers are:
  - `a` is not defined
