### Q1: What is it stored in a project file ?

What information can be stored on a Julia `Project.toml` file ?

```@example q0101

choices = [ # hide
    "The name of the packages directly used in the project (julia scripts)", # hide
    "The ID of the packages directly used in the project (julia scripts)", # hide
    "The minimum and maximum version of the packages directly used in the project (julia scripts) that are compatible with the project", # hide
    "The exact version of the packages directly emploied in the project (julia scripts)", # hide
    "The name of all the dependencies libraries of the project (julia scripts)", # hide
    "The ID of all the dependencies libraries of the project (julia scripts)", # hide
    "The minimum and maximum version of all the dependencies libraries used in the project (julia scripts) that are compatible with the project", # hide
    "The exact version of all the dependencies libraries emploied in the project (julia scripts)", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct" ]  # hide
answers = [1,2,3]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;)  # hide

```

The `Project.toml` file task is to indicate which is the set of packages that works with the given project, but not the concrete istance of the environment that is used in a project, that is the exact version of all directly and indirectly used packages. This is indeed the task of the `Manifest.toml` file.

The correct answers are:
  - "The name of the packages directly used in the project (julia scripts)"
  - "The ID of the packages directly used in the project (julia scripts)"
  - "The minimum and maximum version of the packages directly used in the project (julia scripts) that are compatible with the project"

### Q2: Syntax for comments

Given the following sequence of commands (one for each line) run in an interactive session:

```julia
# a = 1
a = 2 # hello
a = # hello # 3
#= a = 4
#= a = 5 =#
a = 6
=#
```

Which statements are correct ?

```@example q0101
choices = [ # hide
    "`a` is now `1`", # hide
    "`a` is now `2`", # hide
    "`a` is now `3`", # hide
    "`a` is now `4`", # hide
    "`a` is now `5`", # hide
    "`a` is now `6`", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
    "At least one of that commands raises a run-time error", # hide
    "None of that commands raises a run-time error"]  # hide
answers = [2,8]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide
```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

The first command is a comment. On the second one, `a` is assigned the value `2`. The third one raises a syntax error as the equal operator expects a right and a left hand side, while here the right hand side is all commented out. Finally lines 4  to the end is a big nested comment. It results that after that commands have been run, `a` remains assigned to `2`.
The correct answers are:
- "`a` is now `2`"
- "At least one of that commands raises a run-time error"

### Q3: Various syntax rules

Given a file "Foo.jl" with the following code:
```julia
function foo(x)
println(xÂ²)
end
a = [2,3]
foo(a)
foo.(a)
foo(a[1])
```
Which of the following statements are correct ?

```@example q0101
choices = [ # hide
    "The output of `foo(a)` is `[4,9]`", # hide
    "The output of `foo.(a)` is `[4,9]`", # hide
    "The output of `foo(a[1])` is `4`", # hide
    "The output of `foo(a[1])` is `9`", # hide
    "Defining the function produces a run-time error because the body of the function is not idented", # hide
    "Calling the function produces a run-time error because the body of the function is not idented", # hide
    "Calling the function produces a run-time error because Unicode characters (`Â²`) are not allowed in Julia", # hide
    "Calling the function produces a run-time error because `xÂ²` is not defined", # hide
    "None of the (other) sentences is correct", # hide
]  # hide
answers = [8]  # hide
multiq(choices, answers;keep_order=true)  # hide
```

```@raw html
<details><summary>RESOLUTION</summary>
```

First, Unicode characters are allowed (with very rare exceptions) and identation doesn't matter in Julia. We would then be tempted to say hence that the broadcasted call `foo.(a)` produces `[4,9]` as output and `foo(a[1])` produces `4`. However the rising to the power is not obtained by using the Unicode `Â²` character, but using the exponential operator, i.e. `x^2`. `xÂ²` is just an other idetifier name that has not been defined, so the function in all cases returns an error that `xÂ²` is not defined.
The correct answer is:
  - "Calling the function produces a run-time error because `xÂ²` is not defined"
